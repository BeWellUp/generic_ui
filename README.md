generic_ui
==========

A prototype for an AngularDart app that produces a GUI dynamically from JSON metadata

[open demo](http://bewellup.github.io/generic_ui/build/web/index.html)

The GUI is built from [these JSON meta data files]
(https://github.com/BeWellUp/generic_ui/tree/gh-pages/build/web/packages/accorto_prototype/example_data)
(the entity_data.json is just demo data)

I also makes use of the validation support of AngularDart (color indicators for dirty/invalid).
Range checks for numeric fields weren't yet supported when I published this demo app.

I must not disclose the source though.
